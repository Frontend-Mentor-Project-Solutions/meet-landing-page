## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Subgrid

### What I learned

- I used a content grid to layout the page and divide them into `content`, `breakout` and `full-width` sections
- visually place images on top with `order` property while maintaining semantic HTML markup
- used `attr()` to use data-attribute for pseudo-element content

```html
<div class="image-grid breakout" data-number="01"></div>
```

```css
[data-number] {
  &::before {
    content: attr(data-number);
  }
}
```
